# Prerequisites to ensure you have the smoothest experience for the hackathon

## Credentials
To write programs which automatically fetch data from reddit or twitter, you need to generate credentials which let your code authenticate with those websites.

### 1- get twitter credentials
To get twitter credentials, you will first need a regular twitter account.<br>
We suggest creating a dummy one using your student or academic email if you have one, as many university domains are whitelisted by twitter so they will approve your request instantly.<br>
Using a personal email or twitter account that you already use is also fine, as the name of the account or its info will be completely seperate from the project.<br>

1) with a twitter account logged in, visit `https://developer.twitter.com/en/portal/petition/essential/basic-info`
2) fill in your basic info, and follow through the steps. Write something like "university project to learn about machine learning" every time they ask you describe your usage, make sure to answer all questions about monetization or government use with a no.
3) Go to your [twitter developper portal](https://developer.twitter.com/en/portal/dashboard) and click "Apply for elevated access"
4) create a project
### 2- get reddit credentials
